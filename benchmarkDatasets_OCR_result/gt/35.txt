Hands On

Most of us have looked up at the night sky and seen the Milky Way. This provides only
one perspective of the stars. If we use a telescope, we can see the stars and planets in
more detail. A telescope lets us see an individual star in the context of a constellation or
even a specific type of galaxy. But this technique is not only about looking at your data
at different scale levels. Underlying this technique is the idea that we need to expand our
understanding by aggregating the data.

One technique that makes it easy to compare data at different scale levels is to use an
index. For example, let's say that from the mass spectrometer technique, we learn that our
target population is 18- to 34-year-olds who make up 24 percent of the total population
of the country. We can measure that same target population percentage at the census
block group level, or by ZIP code, trade area, county, metropolitan area, or state level. By
dividing each area’s percentage by 24 percent and multiplying by 100, we can create an
index that compares any value to the base population percentage.

While it is relatively easy to remember a single benchmark like 24 percent, the value
of converting all your variables to an index based on 100 is that you will be able to scan
multiple variables and have an almost instant understanding of how any given area relates
to the overall population based on an average, median, percentage, a target number, ora
threshold value.

Insome ways, the microscope is simply the flip side of the telescope technique: drilling down
to asmall area with more details rather than aggregating data up to a larger geographic
area. But the idea behind this technique is to validate assumptions or hypotheses that
we may have made when viewing data at a higher level. If you only look at your data at an

aggregated level, you may miss the specific variables that lead to unexpected conclusions
that may change the way that you do business. So create a map series and zoom in to each
location to check whether the patterns that hold true at a higher level need to be refined
based on the individual characteristics of your data.

A balance scale compares a known weight to something that has an unknown weight
employing a specific unit of measurement. It’s the idea of comparing and contrasting one
thing to another using some standard of measurement.

One of the simplest ways to do this is to rank your data. It could be as simple as
numbering the values from 1 to the highest rank or using a calculation in Excel such as the
RANK.EQ or RANK.AVG functions to ensure that when values are the same, they are given
an equal rank. If you rank your data, it makes it easy to create five classes in your map layer
symbology to show the top 20 percent and bottom 20 percent of your data. In business, it
is common to find that 80 percent of sales come from 20 percent of customers, or (stated
more generally) 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes. By ranking
and classifying your data, it is easy to see which features are most important.
