Photo sharing and
privacy problems often
arise when photos are

visible outside the

originally intended
scope.

Building the Right Code

As a final remark, let us refer back to Lawrence
Lessig’s “Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace,”
first published in 1999, with an updated version
in 2006.7° In this book, Lessig brilliantly
reminded us that protection and regulation of
privacy (and other values) is not done only by
law, but also by our norms, markets, and obvi-
ously the architecture of the systems we build
aS computer scientists. Let us build the right
code to manage forgetting and remembering
on the Internet and the Web. Let us build code
to help protect privacy in the right way! MM
