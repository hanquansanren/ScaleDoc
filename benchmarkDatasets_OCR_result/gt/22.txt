identity-management model. It
also highlights India’s cybersecu-
rity challenges and examines dif-
ferent types of attacks.

IEEE Cloud Computing

Engineering the Internet of
Things (IoT) and cloud services
to provide a coherent software layer
for continuous deployment, provi-
sion, and execution of applications
for various domains is complex.
The authors of “Principles for Engi-
neering IoT Cloud Systems,” from
IEEE Cloud Computing’s March/
April 2015 issue, consider whether
and how IoT cloud systems could
provide a uniform layer to enable
continuous execution of complex
applications consisting of diverse
software components.

IEEE Computer Graphics and
Applications

Robots’ increasing popularity
makes interacting and communi-
cating with them of critical impor-
tance. IEEE CG&A’s May/June
2015 special issue—“Natural User
Interfaces for Adjustable Auton-
omy in Robot Control”—presents
some of the latest research results
in the exploration of natural user
interfaces for robotic control
and teleoperation.

IEEE Intelligent Systems

IEEE Intelligent Systems’ March/
April 2015 issue features articles
on macro-level predictive analyt-
ics, which has benefited from the
ability to use big data for real-time
analysis. The magazine’s May/

6 ComputingEdge

June 2015 special issue—titled
“Predictive Analytics: Predictive
Modeling at the Micro Level’—
addresses micro-level predic-
tive analytics, which uses data to
make inferences about unknown
outcomes relating to individual
firms, people, or situations.

IEEE MultiMedia

The volume and nature of You-
Tube-generated traffic has had
a significant impact on fixed and
mobile networks. Studying You-
Tube traffic characteristics could
enable network engineers to come
up with ways to regulate network
trafic and support the development
of sustainable video-delivery ser-
vices. In “A Survey of Current You-
Tube Video Characteristics,” in JEEE
MultiMedia’s April-June 2015 issue,
the authors discuss their study.

IEEE Annals of the History of
Computing

Few areas of computing capture
more headlines than cybersecurity.
However, historians have barely
scratched the surface of com-
puter security’s history, largely
because of the lack of relevant
source materials. Recently, this has
begun changing, as researchers
have uncovered archival informa-
tion and developed oral histories.
Some of this work is addressed in
IEEE Annals’ April-June 2015 spe-
cial issue on cybersecurity.

IEEE Pervasive Computing

“Approximate Computing: Mak-
ing Mobile Systems More Efficient,”

in IEEE Pervasive Computing’s
April-June 2015 issue, looks at
technology that makes systems
faster and more efficient by being
less than perfect for tasks that
don’t require great precision.
The article explores work in this
area by University of Washington
researchers.

IT Professional

Two increasingly high-profile
technology concepts are sustain-
ability and the Internet of Things
(IoT), also known as the Internet
of Anything. These concepts are
evolving and beginning to con-
verge in some cases, creating
interesting possibilities. [T Pro’s
May/June 2015 special issue cov-
ers the Internet of Anything and
sustainability.

IEEE Micro

IEEE Micro’s March/April 2015
special issue highlights some of
the processors presented at 2014’s
Hot Chips 26 conference. One of
those chips is discussed in the
article “Sparc64 XIfx: Fujitsu’s
Next-Generation Processor for
High-Performance Computing.”
The chip is designed for massively
parallel supercomputer systems.
