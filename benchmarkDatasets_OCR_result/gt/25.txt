The Brief

The GOP’s
new better

halves
By Philip Elliott

THE POLITICAL SPOUSE ONCE HAD A
single space to fill, smiling onstage be-
side her husband and children as the
confetti and balloons streamed down.
Hillary Clinton broke that mold in 1992,
when she offered voters a two-for-one
deal: a favorite cookie recipe and a pro-
posal for universal health care.

These days, the spousal rules seem to
have fallen by the wayside completely.
The current wives (and a husband) of
Republican candidates include two
Wall Street executives, two nurses, an
almost-Ph.D. in marketing and a politi-
cal consultant who once counted one of
her husband’s rivals as a client. Of the
group, at least eight have taken on major
campaign roles such as fundraising,
helping to write policy and keeping mo-
rale high. There are also those who stay
focused on the home front, caring for
children along with occasional charity
work. If there is acommon theme, it is
the lack of uniformity. Today’s spouses
get to support their partners however
they please.
