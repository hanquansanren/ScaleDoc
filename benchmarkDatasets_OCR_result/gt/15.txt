OLED DISPLAY

OLED

A specific type of LCD TV that uses an LED
(light-emitting diode] as a backlight, which
can be either a true backlight or an edge-
lit panel, instead of a CCFL array. LED TVs
have grown in popularity over CCFL LCD
TVs because they can be made slimmer and
more energy efficient.

A display that uses small {just several Crystal

nanometers) semiconductor particles,
called “quantum dots,” to enhance the color
of an otherwise traditional LED TV.

OLED TV

Organic LED technology that doesn’t require
a backlight because each pixel illuminates
itself, typically with increased contrast
ratios and brightness with lower power
consumption than LED TVs; also typically
slimmer, more lightweight, and more
energy-efficient than LCD/LED TVs, due to
their lack of a backlight.

Refresh Rate

The rate, expressed in Hz [Hertz] or fps
[frames per second], at which the screen
refreshes itself; this is directly related to the
display’s power supply. In countries that use
100-120V for AC power, this will be either 24,
30, or a multiple of 60; where 200-240V is
used, this will instead be 25 or a multiple of 50.
A higher refresh rate will display a smoother
image (with corresponding content) because
of the additional video frames displayed.

Aspect Ratio

The ratio of the width of a display or screen to
its height. For standard definition, 4:3 is most
common, whereas 16:9 is most common in
HD displays. 16:10, 17:9, and 2.35:1 aspect
ratios are also commonly found in projectors,
and all represent additional HD formats.

A simulated three-dimensional effect that
some displays and projectors can produce,
usually in conjunction with 3D glasses. The
technology of the glasses must match that
of the display or projector. You want to use
active glasses with active 3D displays and
passive glasses with passive 3D displays.

Describes the amount of detail a display can

produce, based on the number of pixels on
the panel, often described with a graph-like
value representing the number of vertical and
horizontal lines, i.e. 1920 x 1080. Like refresh
rate, the higher the resolution, the clearer the
image will be, with compatible content.

SD / Standard Definition

Resolutions up to and including 640 x 480,
typically associated with non-progressive
DVD players, VHS, and analog TV/cable/
satellite reception, and similar sources. SD
video is in the process of being phased out
of broadcast TV.

HD / High Definition / 720p

Typically describes the video resolution of
1366 x 768, or sometimes the XGA resolution
of 1024 x 768.

Full HD / 1080p

1920 x 1080 resolution.

UHD / 4K

3840 x 2160 resolution; sometimes referred
to as 2160p.

Contrast Ratio

The ratio between the brightest white level a
display can achieve compared to the darkest
black level at a given setting.

Dynamic Contrast Ratio

Similar to contrast ratio, but in order to
measure the brightest white level, the
display is first set to the brightest setting,
then measured, and to determine the
darkest black level, it is then set to the
darkest setting, then measured.

Refers to the number of unique colors a
display can produce; a display that can

display more colors is said to have a “wider”
color gamut.

} HDR |

An acronym for High Dynamic Range.
Per the Ultra HD Alliance, to achieve HDR
certification, a display must either have
a peak brightness over 1000 cd/m2 with
black levels less than 0.05 cd/m2, or a peak
brightness over 540 cd/m2 with black levels
lower than 0.0005 cd/m2. These brightness
levels enable the possibility for a wider
color gamut compared to non-HDR (SDR -
Standard Dynamic Range) displays.

| HDR10 |

HDR technology that uses the Rec.2020
color space with a 10-bit color depth. It uses
static metadata from the video source [i.e. a
streaming media player] for color calibration
of the display. As an open standard, HDR10
is the most common HDR technology.

An HDR format from Dolby Laboratories
that supports a 12-bit color depth within
the Rec.2020 color space. It uses dynamic
metadata from the source, optimizing the
dynamic range frame by frame. Unlike
HDR10, Dolby Vision requires pre-installed
onboard hardware to function.

HLG
An acronym for Hybrid Log-Gamma, HLG is
an HDR format that is backward-compatible
with SDR displays and is used in broadcast
and some streaming services.

Refers to a display that will typically have an
onboard OS [operating system} similar to
that of a computer, with the ability to down-
load and access apps and stream content.
