hrough the creation of immersive environments and installations, artist Laleh
Mehran explores the complex relationship between science, technology, and
theology. Her art pieces blend digitally fabricated structures, computationally
generated imagery, digital sensors, and autonomous machines to produce
complex and responsive spaces. The intricate socio-cultural themes of Mehran’s work are
connected with her personal experiences as an Iranian-American. Her installations provoke
questions about dissent, intolerance, technological control, and personal agency, while
simultaneously providing a context for critical dialogue.

Much of Mehran’s artwork uses inter-
active technology to encourage viewer
participation. In her work “Entropic Or-
der,” a two-axis drawing machine that
inscribes complex geometric patterns
into black sand, alters its behavior based
on viewer presence. One of her most am-
bitious pieces to date, “Men of God, Men
of Nature,” is a site-specific installation
that combines references to Islamic cul-

36

ture, Middle Eastern geography, and the
Kaaba (Islam’s holiest site), in the form
of a black cube. Viewers can enter the
cube’s interior, which is adorned with
intricate, Arabesque patterns and moni-
tors with computationally generated im-
agery that respond to the viewer’s move-
ments through the space. Together with
the artist Christopher Coleman, she cre-
ated “W3FI,” a piece that addresses the

topic of online communities through a
series of immersive projections, which
display ideas and visualizations of real-
time information gathered from the im-
mediate surroundings, visitors, and the
region at large.

We spoke at length with Mehran
about her background, her evolution
as an artist, and the ideas behind her
work.
