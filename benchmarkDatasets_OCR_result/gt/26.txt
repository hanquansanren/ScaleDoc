Do you know what kind of future you are planning?

Is it a future that preserves the quality of air, water, and land systems for our descendants?
Because a sustainable future does not happen by default or by accident, Esri launched the
Green Infrastructure initiative to help you and decision-makers—both within and outside
of government—plan a better future for the United States using GIS.

There is a pressing need to ensure that the nation’s valuable landscapes are not.sac-
rificed as a result of development that is haphazard or poorly conceived. Unlike the gray
infrastructure of bridges, roads, dams, and other structures, this green infrastructure is
precious and cannot be rebuilt once it is lost.

Green infrastructure is actually an old idea that has new vitality, thanks to GIS technol-
ogy. Frederick Law Olmsted, the acknowledged founder of American landscape architec-
ture, recognized the value of setting aside tracts of land and preserving natural scenery
for the enjoyment of everyone, not just the wealthy. Olmsted was a board member of the
commission appointed to oversee the first national park, Yosemite. In his 1865 report,
Olmsted noted that the preservation of the area’s scenic beauty would generate not only
economic returns from tourism but also tremendous benefit to the physical and spiritual
well-being of the nation’s inhabitants.

The objective of the Green Infrastructure initiative is a systematic, information-based
method for transforming communities in the United States into sustainable centers by
identifying and preserving an interconnected system of landscapes at regional, local, and
urban scales. This means addressing green infrastructure proactively at the beginning of
the planning process, rather than reactively at the end.

A green infrastructure approach to development identifies critical landscapes of eco-
logical, scenic, and cultural value and preserves them. Ecologically valuable landscapes
contain features that benefit all living organisms in an area, not just people. Scenic and cul-
turally valuable landscapes are characterized by recreational areas, viewsheds, and similar
features that increase property values and promote tourism.

To be effectively safeguarded, these areas must be considered on multiple scales—
regional, local, and urban. At each scale, maintaining the connectivity of open spaces,
habitats, and parks is important because connectivity provides a resilience to the
components of these landscapes that helps them survive challenges, such as climate
change, better than isolated areas.

Previously, environmental concerns were set aside in favor of what was perceived as eco-
nomic necessity based on the belief that these were competing rather than complementary
aspects of a truly sustainable future. Green infrastructure makes solid economic contribu-
tions. Preserving watersheds protects the water supply and safeguards the health of human
populations that use that water as well as the vegetation and wildlife that depend on it.
Keeping coastal areas intact mitigates the effects of storm events and limits damage to build-
ings and other structures. Unmarred scenic views are valued and enhance property values.

Currently the majority of local government entities that regulate the use of the land
base in the United States do so in isolation from each other and often without tools to
effectively assess existing conditions or model the effects of proposed policy changes.
