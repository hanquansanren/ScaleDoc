3.3 Miulticlass Classifier

Figure 6(c) shows an example of architecture for multiclass classification for 3 classes.
A discriminant function Gy (X) produces an output vector [g1, g2,..-, gc] with one
component for each of the C’ categories. Each component g,; can be interpreted as
a “penalty” for assigning X to the j*” category. A discrete switch module selects
which of the components is connected to the output energy. The position of the switch
is controlled by the discrete variable Y € {1,2,...,C}, which is interpreted as the
category. The output energy is equal to E(W,Y,X) = ee 6(Y — j)g;, where
6(Y — 7) is the Kronecker delta function: 5(u) = 1 for u = 0; 6(u) = 0 otherwise.
Inference consists in setting Y to the index of the smallest component of Gy (X).

The perceptron loss, hinge loss, and negative log-likelihood loss can be directly
translated to the multiclass case.

Figure 7: The implicit regression architecture. X and Y are passed through two functions
Giy, and Gay, . This architecture allows multiple values of Y to have low energies for a given

The architectures described in the previous section are simple functions of Y witha
single minimum within the set V. However, there are tasks for which multiple answers
are equally good. Examples include robot navigation, where turning left or right may
get around an obstacle equally well, or a language model in which the sentence segment
“the cat ate the” can be followed equally well by “mouse” or “bird”.

More generally, the dependency between X and Y sometimes cannot be expressed
as a function that maps X to Y (e.g., consider the constraint X?+Y? = 1). In this case,
which we call implicit regression, we model the constraint that X and Y must satisfy
and design the energy function such that it measures the violation of the constraint.
Both X and Y can be passed through functions, and the energy is a function of their
outputs. A simple example is:

E(W,Y, X) = 5||Gx(Wx, X) — Gy (Wy, Y) IP. (41)
