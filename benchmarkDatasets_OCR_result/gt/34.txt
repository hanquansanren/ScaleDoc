the BiOS Expo, with more than
200 companies, will be held 28-
29 January.

LEADING PHOTONICS
CONFERENCES
Conferences during the week
will cover everything from free-
space laser communication
to holography, plasmonics to
optical coherence tomography
(OCT), superconductors to
nonlinear optics, and quantum
optics to silicon photonics. A
new conference on imaging
technologies for visualizing and
quantifying drug distribution in
tissue is chaired by SPIE members

BUSINESS PROGRAM

The half-day executive forum on the
biophotonics marketplace, 7 am to 12:30 pm
Tuesday, 31, January, is one of several events
in an expanded program for those working in
optics and photonics businesses. The forum
will be hosted by Stephen G. Anderson,
director of industry development for SPIE,
and include a new analysis of the global
market for optics and biophotonics.

SPIE Fellow Bruce J. Tromberg, director
of the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical
Clinic at University of California (UC), Irvine
(USA), and cochair of the translational
research applications track at Photonics
West, will deliver the keynote talk on the
future of personal health management.

Tromberg will also serve on a panel
discussing wearable and wireless devices
for point-of-care testing at the forum.
Other panelists are SPIE Fellow Aydogan
Ozcan of UCLA, a pioneer in telemedicine,
lensless imaging, and mobile health; Gene
Dantsker, director of business development at
Qualcomm Life; and Brad Rice, vice president
of engineering R&D at Profusa (USA).

Other events among the industry program
include a Monday session on startups, with four
entrepreneurs discussing how their optics and
photonics startup “made it” in the commercial
sector. Arun Chhabra, CEO of 8tree, a startup
that won the SPIE Startup Challenge in 2013
with its 3D optical scanner and a finalist for the
2017 Prism Awards, will moderate.

Entrepreneurs on the panel will be SPIE
member Graeme Malcolm, CEO and founder
of M Squared Lasers; Bernardo Cordovez,
president and cofounder of Optofluidics
(USA); SPIE Senior Member Supriya Jaiswal,
CEO and founder of Astrileux Corp. (USA);

8 SPIE Professional | JANUARY 2017

and Manuel Aschwanden, CEO and owner of
Optotune (Switzerland).

On Tuesday, Leo Baldwin, principal
engineer at Amazon (USA), will moderate
a panel on the next optical challenges for
virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality
(AR). SPIE member David Bohn, director of
optical engineering at Microsoft HoloLens
(USA), will be on the panel, along with Vinay
Narayan, VR strategist and advisor with HTC
VIVE (Taiwan), and Scott McEldowney, lead
optics researcher at Oculus (USA).

SHOW DAILY

Other events among the industry program
are panel discussions on solid-state lighting,
silicon photonics, and how to navigate the
“tides and storms of shifting international”
policy waters.

The Photonics West Exhibition, 31
January to 2 February, will have more than
1300 companies showing laser systems,
optoelectronic components, and numerous
devices and technologies for photonics
manufacturing and research. A job fair will

(USA), and Conor L. Evans of the
Wellman Center for Photomedicine (USA).

Conference presentations on selective laser
melting, maser sintering, conformal photonics,
and other innovative applications related to
additive manufacturing technologies will fall
under the third applications track, for photonics
technologies in 3D printing. SPIE Fellow Henry
Helvajian, senior scientist in the Micro/Nano
Technology Department at the Aerospace Corp.
(USA), is chair of the 3D printing track.

Papers accepted in BiOS, LASE, or OPTO
and cross-listed in one of the three applications
tracks are eligible for a “best paper” award in
their respective track.

PLENARY TALKS AT LASE

At LASE, three plenary speakers on
Wednesday will include SPIE Fellow Alberto
Piqué, who will report on his work with
micro-3D structures. Piqué is head of
the Materials and Sensors Branch in the
Materials Science Division at the US Naval
Research Lab.

SPIE member and laser scientist Hakaru
Mizoguchi, CTO and vice president of
Gigaphoton (Japan), will give a plenary talk
on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography,
and Karsten Danzmann, director at the
Max Planck Institute for Gravitational
Physics in Hannover and the Institute for
Gravitational Physics at Leibniz Universitat
Hannover (Germany), will discuss his role in
the successful international effort to detect
gravitational waves in space.

Symposium chairs for LASE 2017 are SPIE
Fellows Koji Sugioka of RIKEN (Japan) and
Reinhart Poprawe of Fraunhofer-Institut
fiir Lasertechnik (Germany). Cochairs are
SPIE Fellow Yongfeng Lu of University of
Nebraska, Lincoln (USA), and Guido Hennig
of Daetwyler Graphics (Switzerland).
