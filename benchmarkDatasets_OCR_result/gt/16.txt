How to Build a Podcast Studio
by Jason Tables

It has been quite an exciting year for podcasting. Hugely popular shows such as
Serial, Radiolab, and Reply All have taken podcasts to new heights in terms of
amazing content, and have also substantially raised the bar for audio production.
While many of these top-notch programs are produced in broadcast studios by
seasoned professionals, you don’t need to be a hot-shot engineer to make great-
sounding podcasts. With an understanding of some basic recording and mixing
techniques, plus the right gear and software, it is possible to achieve pro-sounding
results in the comfort of your own bedroom or garage. In the paragraphs below,
we're going to explore some essential gear for making great-sounding podcasts.

One of the most important components
in making great recordings is the acoustic
environment. For podcasts, you'll generally
want to go for a tight and direct vocal sound,
free of echo and room ambience, from things
like air conditioners and ceiling fans. Find-
ing a quiet, non-reverberant space in your
home can be tricky, but there are some key
points to look for, and some easy, inexpensive
things you can do to improve the acoustics
of your podcast studio. First rule of thumb:
Hard, reflective surfaces that cause echoes
are not your friends. As tempting and poten-
tially relaxing as it may be, do not record your
podcast in the bathtub. Pick a carpeted, spa-
cious room with soft furniture, and try to set
up in the center of the room, away from the
walls and windows.

While these suggestions will definitely make
a difference, if you're serious about prevent-
ing those nasty early reflections that give
your vocal recordings that reverberant, un-
polished sound, an investment in some ba-
sic acoustic treatment will take your studio's
acoustics to new dimensions, and help you
achieve more professional results. If you're a
one- or two-person show with limited space
to work, or if you need your studio to be por-
table, the Auralex DeskMAX Stand-Mounted
Acoustic Panels offer a great solution and
are extremely easy to set up. The DeskMAX
package consists of two 2 x 2’ panels with
built-in mounting stands, and includes a
convenient travel bag to take your show on
the road. As its name suggests, the Desk-
MAX can stand up on your desk or table to
help absorb reflections from nearby walls

and hard furniture. If you want to record
three or four people at a time, the 36-piece
Auralex D36 Roominators Kit provides you
with more comprehensive coverage, with
enough paneling to treat all four walls and
ceiling ina 6x 8x 8 room.

If you've experimented with recording your
voice using your laptop's built-in mic, you've
probably come to the realization that it’s not
going to yield broadcast-quality results. Up-
grading your microphone will make a pro-
found difference in the quality of your vocal re-
cordings, and there are plenty of great options
to choose from. If your show only requires one
microphone, USB mics can offer a simple,
convenient, and cost-effective solution. This
is because they allow the audio signal to be
fed directly into software-based recording ap-
plications, without the need of any additional
hardware. Perhaps the most popular USB
mic of all time, the Blue Snowball, delivers
tried-and-true performance at a price that
won't have you skipping dinners. The Snow-
ball records at 16-bit, 44.1 kHz CD-quality
resolution, and incorporates two separate
capsules to give you a choice between cardi-

oid and omnidirectional pickup patterns. The
cardioid polar pattern has a more focused
pickup and generally “hears” whatever the
mic is pointed at, while the omnidirection-
al pattern picks up sounds in all directions.
However, for podcasts with just one person
speaking into the mic at a time, you will gen-
erally want to stick to using the cardioid pat-
tern, which will yield the tightest vocal sound,
and pick up the least room ambience.

If you have a little more dough to spend and
are looking for a higher-end, more profes-
sional solution, mics like the Senal UB-440
Professional USB Microphone and the Blue
Yeti USB Microphone offer higher-quality
48 kHz recording, as well as dedicated 1/8"
headphone outputs for monitoring. My per-
sonal favorite USB mic for getting that big,
deep broadcast vocal sound is the RODE
Podcaster. The Podcaster features a dynam-
ic transducer, rather than a condenser ele-
ment like the other mics | mentioned. While
this makes the mic a bit less sensitive than
the others, it also gives it the advantage of
being less prone to picking up unwanted
mouth sounds, such as lip smacks and oth-
er noises. The Podcaster also features head-
phone monitoring and 48 kHz resolution but,
unlike the other USB mics, it doesn’t have
an integrated stand, so youll have to pick
up a broadcast arm like the Auray BA-2EU
Two-Section Broadcast Arm with Integrated
USB Cable to go along with it.

If your show has more than one host, or if
you plan to have guests, you'll need two or
more microphones. Although it's possible
