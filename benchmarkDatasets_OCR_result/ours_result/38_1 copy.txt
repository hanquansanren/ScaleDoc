the classic, text-oriented information retri¢
approach, where text was found in the docu:

video, and music). In the 1990s, researchers
started to explore the possibilities of analyzing
the actual (audio-visual) content of multimedia
items to automatically infer semantic similarities
and textual labels reflecting what is depicted in
an image or a video frame and what is audible in
a soundtrack. The main motivation for this st

More recently, inspired by the rapid develop-

Multimedia Search: From Relevance

Different stages have been marked by the
dominance of some key theoretical and algorith-
mic paradigms. For instance, the content-based
stage started with an exploration of abroad range
of audio-visual signal analysis methods but it
later increasingly turned more toward well-estab-
lished algorithmic frameworks, such as support
vector machines (SVMS). Similarly, graph theory:
has provided the main analytic framework for
the Web-based stage. The most recent algorith-
mic hype in the field is deep learning,
