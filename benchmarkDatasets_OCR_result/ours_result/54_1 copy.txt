Notice that the reshape function creates a new array and does not itself modify the original
array.

Keep in mind that Python's name-binding approach still applies to arrays. The copy function
can be used to create a new, separate copy of an array in memory if needed:

35> a = np.array((1, 2, 3], float)

Lists can also be created from arrays:

>>> a = np.array({1, 2, 3], float)
eC

(a)
[2.0, 2.0, 3.01

‘One can convert the raw data in an array to a binary string (i.e., not in human-readable form)
using the tost ring function. The fromst ring function then allows an array to be created
from this data later on. These routines are sometimes convenient for saving large amount of
array data in files that can be read later on:

‘>>> a = array({1, 2
55> 8 = a.tostring(
>>> 8 ‘

>>> np. fromstring:|
array([1., 2-, 3.
