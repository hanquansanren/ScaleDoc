a registration document and a registration sticker for the windshield or vehicle
plates. If you purchased the vehicle from someone other than a New York State
registered dealership, you will also receive a 10-day inspection extension sticker on
request when you register the vehicle. You must then have the vehicle inspected
within 10 days from the date of registration. It should have a valid inspection sticker
if you purchased the vehicle from a New York State registered dealer. The dealer
must have the vehicle inspected within 30 days before it sells the vehicle to you.

When you purchase a new or used vehicle from a dealer registered with the
DMY, the dealer can register the vehicle for you and give you a temporary registration
and, if you need them, new vehicle plates. The dealer can charge a processing fee for
this service. It can also charge registration, vehicle plate and title fees.

If your vehicle is a 1973 or newer model, your title certificate will be mailed to
you from Albany several weeks after the vehicle is registered.

Proof of Ownership

If you purchase your vehicle from a New York State registered dealer, the proof
of ownership for a new vehicle will be a Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin (MCO)
and a dealer's Certificate of Sale (MV-50). For a used 1973 or newer vehicle, proof
of ownership is the previous owner's Certificate of Title (MV-999), the correct
odometer and salvage disclosure statement and the dealer's Certificate of Sale
(MV-50). For a used 1972 or older vehicle, proof of ownership is the dealer's
Certificate of Sale (MV-50) and the previous owner’s transferable registration
signed over to the dealer.

If the dealership does not register the vehicle for you, make sure it gives
you the ownership documents listed above and a completed Application for
Registration/Title (MV-82) signed by the dealer's representative. Examine the
ownership documents carefully before closing the sale.

If you purchase a used vehicle from a dealer registered outside New York State —
the proof of ownership is the title certificate or transferable registration signed over
to the dealer by the previous owner, plus the bill of sale and/or invoice from the
dealer and other proofs from the dealer.

For a used vehicle purchased from a private seller - the proof of ownership is
the “Certificate of Title” (MV-999), or a transferable registration for 1972 or older
models, signed over to you. The seller must complete and you must acknowledge
with your signature, the correct odometer and damage disclosure statements.

Before you accept the title certificate from any seller, check the front of the title
for the names and addresses of “lien” holders. A lien indicates the current owner
owes money on a loan for the vehicle. If a lien is listed on the title, askthe seller to
give you proof the lien has been paid ~ in most cases, it is an officiallien release
from the lender. If proof is not provided and the loan has not been paid, the lien
holder could repossess the vehicle
