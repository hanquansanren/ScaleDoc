Blood testing holds similar poten-
tial for people with rheumatoid arthritis,
(Ra), an immune-triggered disorder that
causes painful inflammation in the joints
and can severely restrict movement. Tra-
ditional blood tests for inflammation—a
hallmark characteristic of RA and other
autoimmune diseases—aren't especially
helpful, since inflammatory markers can
also be a sign that the patient has a cold
‘or some other condition the immune sys-
tem is fighting.

Scientists at Crescendo Bioscienc
a San Francisco company developing a
number of blood-based diagnostics for
such diseases, have developed a test that
looks at a dozen blood markers for RA
and can rank patients’ inflammation as
mild, moderate or severe. This is criti-
cal because treating early inflammation
