IEEE Annals of the History of
Computing

Few areas of computing capture
more headlines than cybersecurity.
However, historians have barely
scratched the surface of com-
puter security's history, largely
because of the lack of relevant
source materials. Recently, this has
begun changing, as researchers
have uncovered archival informa.
tion and developed oral histories,
Some of this work is addressed in
