In an article in the Winter 2016 issue of ArcUser. 1 addressed the
need for and benefits of documenting GIS results as well as the ad-
vantages of adopting the right ROL mind-set. In “(Downsizing the ROL
Report” in the Spring 2016 issue, I reviewed the target audience for
RO! reports, shared a different approach to documenting ROI, and
provided a one-page ROI and Benefits Report template that could be
downloaded from the online version ofthe article:

“The online version of this article has links to Ewo reports created
using the template. They are referenced in case you want to down
load them, Look at the ROI and Benefits Report for the Wildland
Urban Interface (WUD Project Geodatabase Compilation project
carried out by the Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands (FFSL).
The Executive Summary portion notes that not all the organization’
relevant information could be used to make decisions. The Tangible
Benefits section of this same report describes how a repeatable
method for producing more timely, higher-quality data is now part
of the organization's decision-SUpPort process.

‘Your leaders need to Know the bad and the ugly of your current
information and process limitations so they can accurately asses:

“The 60 hours required by this project to clean and organize years
of data reduced the original 10-hour. unstructured job that had a
high risk of error to a 12-minute, easy-to-repeat task that had the
added benefit of standardizing the data. The fact that the task was
repeated numerous times throughout the year and produced both
RO! and tangible benefits made this GiS enhancement a no-brainer.

‘he measures of success at the bottom of this report are criti
cal components of the report because they do two essential things.
First, they describe the actions necessary to assess and validate the
report's initial assumptions. Even if leadership doesn't ask for this
information, the GIS professional should be compelled to discover,
these metrics. Second, the measurements provide expectations for
the GIS professional, who should think in terms of business perfor-
‘mance and accountability. As I stated in previous articles, ROI stu
ies are not conducted enough in our discipline. IfGIS managers don't
start having higher expectations for GIS staff performance, we will,
keep getting the same results,

‘The ROI and Benefits Report for the Statewide 3-D Stereo Model
‘Acquisition project describes a project done by the Utah Geological
Survey (UGS). I wanted to share this report for a very important
reason. Its most notable benefit is cost avoidance, and that is the gift
that keeps on giving.

‘As you can imagine, fieldwork constitutes a core activity of geo
logic mapping. This fieldwork, along with associated expenses for
hotels, per diem, transportation, fuel. and labor. represents a sig-
nificant cost of doing business for the UGS. By addressing these
