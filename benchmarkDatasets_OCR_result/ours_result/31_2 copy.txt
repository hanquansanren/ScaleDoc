‘That is, a worldview constituted from
multiple sites of enunciation, pre-emi-
nently those situated at the margins of
the world system.

Having outlined some of the ba-
sic features of decolonial thinking, it
becomes possible to consider, albeit
briefly, how they might be applied in a
computing context.

In contrast to the postcolonial com-
puting approach described earlier, and
inspired by the decolonial turn referred
to previously, the idea of decolonial
computing has recently been proposed
‘as a response to computing’s “colonial
impulse” (7). Grounded in a synthesis of
the oppositional critical race philoso-
phy of Charles W. Mills and the work of
decolonial scholars—such as Mignolo,
Grosfoguel and Nelson Maidonado-Tor
res—decolonial computing attempts to
‘engage with the phenomenon of com
puting from a perspective informed by
{even If not situated at) the margins or

of the modern world system
wherein issues of body politics and gco-
politics are analytically foregrounded.
Put differently, decolonial computing,
as a critical project, Is about interrogat-
ing who is doing computing, where they
are doing it, and, thereby, what comput-
ing means both epistemologically (that
is, in relation to knowing) and ontologi-
ally (that is, in relation to being).

‘Adopting a decolonial perspective
enables a crucial difference between
decolonial and postcolonial computing
to be brought into bold relief. Namely,
early formulators of the latter position,
such as Dourish and Mainwaring (2)
are completely silent on issues of race,
as are other proponents of postcolonial
‘computing who instead speak in terms
of “colonial, “cultural,” and “power”
formations. Another distinction be-
tween decolonial and postcolonial
computing is the latter is
also silent on questions of reparations.
Although Dourish and Mainwaring rec-

“the overriding question, ‘What
might we build tomorrow?’ blinds us to

paraphrase media theorist Wendy Hui
Kyong Chun, we need to examine “race
and/as computing.”
In this connection, one landmark
study that might be associated with
decolonial computing is the disserta
tion of Mahendran; an exploration of
the emergence of race and computation
in modernity, and their convergence
in the contemporary postmodern era,
in terms of the mind-body polarity as
viewed through the “lens” of existential
phenomenology (8). According to Ma-
hendran, “the historical idea of Man,
fas the secular human — developed
through the violent devolution of bodily
‘experience, in favor of detached caleu
lative rationality, from which computa-
tion and race have emerged. This has
placed Man over and against the natu:
ral world that extends beyond the mind,
especially the body and others who are
constituted outside the norm of Man
[that is, people of non European de-
scent)” Crucially, he argues, ~This nor-
mative distinction between mind and
body finds a more radical expression in
Alan M. Turing’s concept of the digital
‘computer, a founding theory of comput-
‘er science and information technology.
‘On the one hand the digital computer
decouples the bodily from existence,
proof of the teleological development of
a technological rational humanity. On
the other hand, race limits existence to
the bodily, as a fundamental barrier to
humanity. It can be said that modern
‘computation is the angelic ascent from
‘one’s body, while race is the hellish de~
‘scent into one’s body.”
While ground breaking in its en-
gagement with issues at the intersec-

tion of race and computing—more
specifically, computation—and while
hinting at the need to engage also
with issues of religion andior theok
‘ogy, Mahendran’s argument needs
augmenting in light of the “embodied
turn” within computing and cognitive
science, Drawing upon Frantz Fanon's
«critique of the embodied phenomenol-
ogy of Merleau-Ponty, Mahendran
mounts a decolonial critique of ab-
stract disembodied—that is, universal
and formal—computing of the Turing-
computational variety. However, this
line of critique requires extending to
cover abstract embodied—that is, uni-
versal and physical—computing. For
‘example, ubicomp, at least as concep-
tualized in the phenomenologically
inspired approach to embodied inter-
action developed by Paul Dourish and
others, invokes the figure of the body
in the context of tangible, wearable,
kinesthetic, gesture-based, and related
computing technologies. Yet aceord-
Ing to Ali, this isa somewhat “abstract”
conception of the body insofar as it is

analysis along body-political and geo-
political lines readily discloses that
such de-racing tends to be effected, at
least in the first instance, if not there-
after, by theorists, designers, research-
cers, developers etc. who are white (and
male) and Western—that is, situated
within the Global North. Understand-
ing who is responsible for carrying out
the de-racing of the body, from where
and how (that is, in what terms) is cru-
cial because the abstract body that is
produced tends to be presented by the
de-racers as “universal,” thereby tac-
itly masking or concealing (intention-
lly o otherwise) the particularity or
specificity of this body. Put simply, the
abstract of universal body of ubicomp
and related disciplines) is arguably
Eurocentric/Western centric.

‘To reiterate: ‘The embodied turn
within computing constitutes a move-
‘ment from an abstract disembodied
computing to an abstract embodied
computing. However, this movement
tends to pre-emptively bracket or fore-
close consideration of what might be de~
seribed as “the decolonial question con-
cerning embodiment” (to paraphrase
