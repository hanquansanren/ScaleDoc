mw BEING PASSED

If another vehicle passes you on the left, decrease speed slightly and keep to
the right. When the vehicle has safely passed and is ahead of you, continue your
normal speed.

Ifyou find that you are being passed on the right by many vehicles, you should
move into the right lane and allow them to pass you on the left.

m SCHOOL BUSES

When a stopped school bus flashes its red light(s), traffic that approaches from
either direction, even in front of the school and in school parking lots, must stop
before it reaches the bus. You should stop at least 20 feet (6 m) away from the bus.
You can identify this bus by a “SCHOOL BUS” sign, the red lights on the top and its
unique yellow-orange color.

Before a school bus stops to load or discharge passengers, the driver will usually
flash yellow warning lights. When you see them, decrease speed and be prepared to stop.

When you stop for a school bus, you can not drive again until the red lights stop
flashing or when the bus driver or a traffic officer signals that you can proceed. This
law applies on all roadways in New York State. You must stop for a school bus even if
it is on the opposite side of a divided highway.

After you stop for a school bus, look for children along the side of the road.
Drive slowly until you have passed them.

Safety Tip: Most school bus-related deaths and injuries occur while children cross
the street after being discharged from the bus, not in collisions that involve school buses.

Remember that vehicles that transport disabled persons can be equipped as
school buses and you must stop for them as you would for other school buses.

The fine when you pass a stopped school bus ranges from a minimum of $250
for a first violation to a maximum of $1,000 for three violations in three years. If you
are convicted of three of these violations in three years, your driver license will be
revoked for a minimum of six months.
